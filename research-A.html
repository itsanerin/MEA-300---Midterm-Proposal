    <h2>Research Site A</h2>

    <div class="container-fluid">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm">

                <p>As I said in my Challenge Statement, my primary goal is to turn this site into a functional musician's website. I felt that the original site was missing components, but I'm not quite sure what. Therefore, this is the first topic I've decided to research: What does an effective musician's website need?</p>
                <p>The first research site I found to be useful is an article on the site, DIY Musician, titled <a href="https://diymusician.cdbaby.com/music-promotion/10-things-every-musician-website-must-have/" target="_blank">10 things every musician website must have."</a> It is incredibly helpful to me to have a guide I can refer to for gathering the content and mapping out the pages I'll need to make an effective muscian's website.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm">
                <img src="images/sitelist1.JPG" class="img-fluid" />
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm">
                <img src="images/sitelist2.JPG" class="img-fluid" />
                <p style="margin-top: 10%;"> I will try to implement as much of these as possible. Since Jerimiah Black is still in the beginnings of his music career, he doesn't have much press, a merch store, or an email list. That removes some of #2, 8, 9, and 10 from the website I'll be creating. The rest, however, are important aspects that I look forward to implemeting.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row align-items-center">
            <div class="col-sm">
                <img src="images/new/gallery%20html-2.JPG" class="img-fluid" />
                <p>A blend of hi-res photos and videos (#2 and #4) will be featured on the Gallery page. I embedded several of the different media from J. Black's own social media posts from his Instagram and Facebook in order to encourage site users to follow him, as well as to increase the views he receives on those sites.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="col-sm">
                <img src="images/new/gallery-browser-2.JPG" class="img-fluid" />
                <p>The nature of various types of embedded media (i.e: uploaded images, embedded iframes, both pics and videos) made it very difficult to implement a media carousel for the gallery, so I settled on creating a fully responsive 3-column gallery layout using the Bootstrap 4 grid system.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row align-items-center">
            <div class="col-sm">
                <img src="images/new/music-browser.JPG" class="img-fluid" />
                <p>I covered #3 in the Music tab, replacing the individual tracks and lyric pages from the original site with an embedded SoundCloud music player. I like this embedded player better becasue it automatically updates with any new music J. Black adds to his profile, and contributes to the number of plays on his SoundCloud account. In the future, I'd like to come up with a way to make this web page more aesthetically appealing to the user, possibly by adding a background image or some other sort of visual. I'd also like to follow the advice of the article further, by adding a player that can be accessed from each page so that the user can listen while browsing the other pages of the website. #6 is also covered on this page, because industry professionals would be most interested in J. Black's music. His business email address is featured in large print directly below the music player.</p>

        <div class="row align-items-center">
            <div class="col-sm">
                <img src="images/new/calendar-browser.JPG" class="img-fluid" />
                <p>For #7, a concert calendar, I felt that a Bootstrap grid would most accurately portray the feel of a real calendar. J. Black makes posters for each one of his events, but rather than rely solely on images, which can sometimes fail to load or be difficult to read on some devices, I gave the event and venue information in text beside each of the posters. This design decision also helps with accessibility of his event information to those who are visually impaired.</p>
