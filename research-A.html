                <p>The first website I found to be useful is an article on the site, DIY Musician, titled <a href="https://diymusician.cdbaby.com/music-promotion/10-things-every-musician-website-must-have/" target="_blank">10 things every musician website must have."</a> It is incredibly helpful to me to have a guide I can refer to for gathering the content and mapping out the pages I'll need to make an effective muscian's website.</p>

                <p> I will try to implement as much of these as possible. Since Jerimiah Black is still in the beginnings of his music career, he doesn't have much press, a merch store, or an email list. That removes some of #2, 8, 9, and 10 from the website I'll be creating. The rest, however, are important aspects that I look forward to implemeting.</p>

            <div class="col-sm">
                <p>A blend of hi-res photos and videos (#2 and #4) will be featured on the Gallery page. I embedded several of the different media from J. Black's own social media posts from his Instagram and Facebook in order to encourage site users to follow him, as well as to increase the views he receives on those sites.</p>
                <p>The nature of various types of embedded media made it very difficult to implement a media carousel for the gallery, so I settled on creating a fully responsive 3-column gallery layout using the Bootstrap 4 grid system.</p>
