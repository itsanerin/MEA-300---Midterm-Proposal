                    <p>The target audiences of this website will be fans, potential fans, and venues/companies/individuals who are interested in hiring a musician. Fans and potential fans will be able to access all of J. Black's social media links, listen to his Soundcloud tracks, and find out when and where they can see his upcoming performances. Potential clients can listen to various samples of his original work, get a glimpse of his stage presence from the videos in the Gallery, and contact him directly. </p>


                    <p>Upon conducting research that delved deeper into the audience that would want to reach this website. In retrospect, I should have optimized the website to generate more results to reach a wider audience through online search engines. Noting the frequent searches for independent music by New Yorkers, with second largest search terms - independent artist & local artist - which conveys to me, that this should have been more expressed in the website. In future projects and designs, this is an important lesson and tool I'd like to carry forward, I will definitely keep this is mind when reaching out to an audience on a digital platform.</p>
