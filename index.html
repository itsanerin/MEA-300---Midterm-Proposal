                <p class="text">For the final project, I will design a website that will exhibit a friend's (Jerimiah Black's) original music. In order to establish himself as a professional musician, J. needs a platform to build upon and interact with his fan base, book gigs, accept commissions, and showcase his music and stage presence. </p>
                <p class="text">I made <a href="http://mmp.bmcc.cuny.edu/erin.brady/final/index.html" target="_blank"> the first version of the website</a> at the end of my prior MMP 100 class, using only basic HTML and CSS.</p>
                <p class="text">The original site consisted of a basic vanilla CSS navbar, only 3 main pages (Home, About, and Music), and only 4 of Black's songs. Each song had its own page with an album cover, lyrics, and a basic web player. The social media links could only be found at the bottom of the About page.</p>

            <div class="col-sm">
                <p class="text">As you can see, the site was overly simplistic and lacking in aesthetic allure, so I decided to completely overhaul the site for my final project. The script text on the homepage is bulky and awkward, there's no indication of what page is currently being viewed in the navbar, there's no inherent reason for showcasing a song's lyrics except to provide background or meaning, of which none is provided. While the original site did serve its purpose to showcase the basic HTML and CSS code I had learned, it did not function as a proper website for a musician to use. I intend to change that for my final for this class.</p>
